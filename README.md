## 👋 Hi, I’m Amran Hossain

🎓 PhD Researcher | 🤖 Data Science, Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
🧠 Healthcare AI | 🗣️ Speech & Audio Processing

I work on applied machine learning, speech signal processing, and healthcare applications, with a focus on building data-driven systems for neurological disorder detection, particularly Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease from voice and speech data.

I am actively seeking opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Applied AI, where I can translate research into scalable, real-world solutions.

### 🔍 What I Do
- Develop end-to-end ML pipelines for audio and speech data
- Extract and analyze acoustic biomarkers (MFCC, GTCC, pitch, jitter, shimmer)
- Build and evaluate ML & DL models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, CNN)
- Apply statistical analysis and cross-validation on healthcare datasets
- Focus on model interpretability and practical deployment

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, SQL
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Librosa, Praat (Parselmouth), Mel-Spectrograms
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Feature Engineering
- Tools: Git, Linux, Jupyter, Docker (basic)

### 📌 Featured Projects
🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Detection from Speech and voice
- Built ML and DL models using acoustic and spectral features
- Implemented speaker diarization and silence-based segmentation
- Achieved strong performance using Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Tech: Python, Praat, Librosa, PyTorch

🗣️ Spontaneous Dialogue Analysis for PD Detection
- Processed multi-speaker clinical conversations
- Automated feature extraction and ML-ready datasets (CSV pipelines)
- Focused on robust evaluation and reproducibility

- Acoustic Feature Engineering for Healthcare AI
- CNN Models for PD daiagnosis form Audio signals
